# User Service

User Service is a RESTful API built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. It provides functionality for user authentication, account management, and basic CRUD operations on a user table in a PostgreSQL database.


It provides the following functionality:


1. User Login (User Service):

   - Test Case 1: Valid User Login

      Input: Valid username and password
      Expected Output: Successful login

   - Test Case 2: Invalid User Login

      Input: Invalid username or password
      Expected Output: Error message

   - Test Case 3: Brute Force Attack Protection

      Input: Multiple invalid login attempts within a short time
      Expected Output: Account lockout or additional security measures

### Database Schema

```
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_phone VARCHAR(20),
    mailing_address VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.
2. **Database Integration**: Connects to a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve user information.
3. **Express Framework**: Built on the Express framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
4. **RESTful API**: Follows RESTful principles for designing APIs.

### Running the Project

Before running the project, make sure to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Local Server

```bash
npm run start
```

### Start the Database Server

Assuming the database is set up with the required schema and configuration:

```bash
pg_ctl -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@14 start
```

```bash
psql postgres # Launch the PostgreSQL shell
/conninfo # View connection details
```

### API Endpoints

- GET /users: Retrieve a list of all users.
- GET /users/:id: Retrieve details of a specific user (protected route, requires authentication).
- POST /users: Create a new user.
- PUT /users/:id: Update details of a specific user (protected route, requires authentication).
- DELETE /users/:id: Delete a specific user.

### Authentication Endpoints

- POST /auth/login: Login a user and return a JWT.
- POST /auth/signup: Create a new user

### Technology Stack

Node.js
Express
PostgreSQL
JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

```

### Security Considerations

User authentication is implemented using JWT for secure and stateless communication.
Passwords are hashed before storing them in the database to enhance security.
Routes are protected using middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access them.
